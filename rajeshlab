Disqualified MLA P. Vetrivel on Wednesday released to the media a video clipping that shows former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa on a hospital bed.

The 20-second clipping shows Jayalalithaa sipping a 'juice' with her left hand. However, there is no information as to when the video was shot.

Mr. Vetrivel told reporters that it was taken by his leader V.K. Sasikala after the former Chief Minister was shifted from the ICU.

The release of the video had nothing to do with the bypoll scheduled for Dr. Radhakrishnan Nagar Assembly constituency on December 21, he said, adding that there were more such video clippings in their possession.

Jayakumar sees ulterior motive
Minister and AIADMK leader D. Jayakumar alleged that the footage was released with an “ulterior motive,”, with the bypoll scheduled for tomorrow.
Why Mr. Vetrivel didn’t submit the video to the Commission of Inquiry, which is probing Jayalalithaa's death, Mr. Jayakumar asked and urged the Election Commission of India to take action against Mr. Vetrivel for releasing the video.

The Minister was speaking to reporters in the Secretariat along with his Cabinet colleagues R. Kamaraj and P. Thangamani.

Meanwhile, the Returning Officer of R.K. Nagar Assembly constituency has instructed all television channels not to showcase the video footage terming that such telecast was in violation to Section 126 (1) (b) of the Representation of Peoples Act, 1951.x
